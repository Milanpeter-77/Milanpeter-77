# Data Science Portfolio
Data analysis has captivated me from the very start, with its unique ability to transform raw information into actionable insights using applied mathematical methods. What excites me most about this field is the potential to make nicely visualised, data-driven decisions that can drive meaningful change. From building complex economic forecast models to exploring new ways of classifications, I’m driven by the challenge of making sense of data in different ways.

In this portfolio, I’m proud to present projects that showcase my skills and dedication to data science. You'll find a range of models I've developed - either by myself of with teams. Each project has helped me sharpen my technical expertise and push the boundaries of what data science can achieve. This portfolio is a reflection of my ongoing commitment to learning and my enthusiasm for driving real-world value through data. 

The projects in my portfolio can be classified into five groups:

:page_facing_up: **Research:** Universities in Hungary have a renowned scientific event called Scientific Students’ Associations Conference (SSA, or TDK in Hungarian). It is an annual contest that offers an open platform for the works of students seeking to gain academic knowledge beyond the regular curriculum. Basically, your task is writing a research paper in an academic quality, then - if you are selected - you have to present your work to a professional jury. Thanks to this opportunity, I could conduct more quantitative research, which of course required coding as well.

:school: **Coursework:** During my academic years, I took several courses that taught me how to analyze data and write scripts in various programming languages. This experience allowed me to deepen my knowledge across multiple subjects and programming tools.

## What factors play significant roles during yact pricing? :motor_boat:
### Fall Semester of 2022 - Coursework Project
**Description:** The task involved analyzing yacht and motorboat pricing using the "yacht_pricing" dataset. The goal was to predict the price in euros based on various characteristics, including boat type, year built, condition, dimensions (length, width, depth), displacement, number of cabins and beds, fuel capacity, engine hours, and recent views. This analysis aimed to determine which factors significantly impact yacht prices, adjusting the model to address multicollinearity issues, and refining it through diagnostic tests and specification adjustments.

**Methodologies:** Exploratory Data Analysis, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression, Model Diagnostics and Specification Adjustments

**Languages:** R
