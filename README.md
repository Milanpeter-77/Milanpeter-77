# Data Science Portfolio
Data analysis has captivated me from the very start, with its unique ability to transform raw information into actionable insights using applied mathematical methods. What excites me most about this field is the potential to make nicely visualised, data-driven decisions that can drive meaningful change. From building complex economic forecast models to exploring new ways of classifications, Iâ€™m driven by the challenge of making sense of data in different ways.

In this portfolio, Iâ€™m proud to present projects that showcase my skills and dedication to data science. You'll find a range of models I've developed - either by myself of with teams. Each project has helped me sharpen my technical expertise and push the boundaries of what data science can achieve. This portfolio is a reflection of my ongoing commitment to learning and my enthusiasm for driving real-world value through data. 

The projects in my portfolio can be classified into four groups:

:page_facing_up: **Research:** Universities in Hungary have a renowned scientific event called Scientific Studentsâ€™ Associations Conference (SSA, or TDK in Hungarian). It is an annual contest that offers an open platform for the works of students seeking to gain academic knowledge beyond the regular curriculum. Basically, your task is writing a research paper in an academic quality, then - if you are selected - you have to present your work to a professional jury. Thanks to this opportunity, I could conduct more quantitative research, which of course required coding as well.

:school: **Coursework:** During my academic years, I took several courses that taught me how to analyze data and write scripts in various programming languages. I had to work on these projects either by myself or with a group of other students. That is why it taught me not only hard skills but also communication and presentation skills.

:trophy: **Competitions:** Participating in data science competitions has been a cornerstone of my learning journey. These challenged me to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios under tight deadlines. Through these experiences, I refined my coding, problem-solving, and teamwork skills. Each competition taught me new techniques, from algorithm optimization to innovative data visualization approaches, further enhancing my analytical toolkit.

:bulb: **Personal:** Outside formal settings, I enjoy exploring data science and modeling through personal projects. These often focus on topics that spark my curiosity as well as my creativity. These self-directed projects allow me to experiment with new methods and tools, further building my expertise in data science and quantitative analysis.

## How does the Hungarian Foreign Exchange Market reacts to the interest rate increases? :coin:
### Spring Semester of 2024 - Research Project
**Description:** In my thesis, I investigated the effects of interest rate increases on the Hungarian forintâ€™s exchange rate amid supply-side inflation in Europe. Using an event study methodology, I analyzed whether these monetary policy measures significantly impacted the forintâ€™s value relative to a basket of key currencies. My research hypothesis suggested that, during this unique inflationary period, interest rate hikes had minimal influence on exchange rates, potentially signaling the need for alternative approaches to managing inflation. The study aimed to provide insights into the limitations of traditional monetary policy tools in atypical economic conditions.

**Methodologies:** Event Study Design, Return Calculation Using Interest Rate Parity, Data Visualization and Analysis

## How would you forecast the effects of climate change on agricultural businesses? :corn:
### April of 2023 - Competition Project
**Description:** The task involved supporting an American credit institution in assessing the climate risk of its agricultural investments by predicting crop yields in Minnesota. Our objective was to develop a model that forecasts potential losses in productivity due to climate change, focusing on three crops: corn, oats, and soybeans. We utilized historical crop yield and weather data, aggregated and cleaned the datasets, and built several linear multivariate OLS regression models of increasing complexity. The final model selected was a transformed linear regression, which provided reliable predictions of future crop yields, enabling the bank to make informed decisions regarding loan risk assessments.

## Do monetary policy decisions influence the Hungarian forint exchange rate? :bank:
### Spring Semester of 2023 - Research Project
**Description:** My thesis investigates how monetary policy decisions by the National Bank of Hungary (MNB) influence the exchange rate of the Hungarian forint, especially in the short term. Following the end of the MNBâ€™s extensive tightening cycle in 2022, the forint fell sharply, sparking public and media attention. This piqued my curiosity, motivating me to explore whether such monetary interventions have a significant effect on the exchange rate. My findings reveal that, in the short term, monetary policy decisions do not significantly impact the exchange rate, supporting my hypothesis. This conclusion aligns with existing literature, suggesting that factors beyond monetary policy also play a role in influencing the forintâ€™s value.

## What makes the 2022 tech layoffs different? :technologist:
### Spring Semester of 2023 - Research/Competition Project
**Description:** In this study, we examined the effect of companiesâ€™ layoff announcements on the stock market via the event study methodology. We also analysed the market reaction differences between tech and non-tech sectors. We found that, despite adverse market conditions, the stocks of the companies that laid off workers had positive cumulated average abnormal returns. We also find a statistically significant difference between the stock market reaction of the tech and the non-tech sectors. We concluded that layoffs can result in positive abnormal returns for a companyâ€™s stock given that it has a cost-efficiency-enhancing purpose, and it can also vary depending on the human resource necessity of the given industry the company is functioning in.
